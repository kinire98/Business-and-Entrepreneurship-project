Each one of these should be a separate folder, the content will be inside


Then I will make a document where I describe the content of each one of the pages.
The images come first
NOT  take images with author rights
An image is worth more than a 1000 words
This is more focused to an enterprise not a portfolio

Images 1920x1280

The page will be designed according to the SPA philosiphy but wihtout components
Inspired by [brand.twitch.tv](https://brand.twitch.tv) with this [colors](https://brand.twitch.tv/expression/) or [these](https://brand.twitch.tv/brand/), dark colors with popping neon elements (backgrounds) on hover, details like borders shall dissapear. When not hovering, then neon colors shall be in the borders or other details

The font used for everything will be [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppin)

**_EVERYTHING UNDER THE LITTLE DETAILS WILL BE DONE AFTER THE MAIN CONTENT_**
**_Even if the details make the difference, FIRST WILL BE DONE THE MAIN CONTENT AND STRUCTURE OF THE PAGE, DEAFULT COLORS AND STUFF_**

The logo will be a giant dynamic animated glitched K I'l have to do that
